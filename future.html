            <p class="future-content">In the future my goal is to work either as a full stack or backend developer in any sized company.</p>

            <p class="future-content"> I had the opportunity to work briefly as a full-stack developer, and during that time, I discovered that I thoroughly enjoy solving complex 
                problems related to databases, API integrations, and backend logic. </p>

            <p class="future-content">Of course, that's not to say I dislike front-end developmentâ€”it has its own challenges and rewards. 
                However, my primary enjoyment in coding comes from working with the backend, where I can focus on logic, data structures, and system architecture.</p>
            
                <p class="future-content">I am also interested in working with cloud technologies such as AWS and Azure.</p>
